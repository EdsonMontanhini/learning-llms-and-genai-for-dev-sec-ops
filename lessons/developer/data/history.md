# A history lesson on Devops

## Devopsdays

Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. Each event is run by volunteers from the local area.

Most devopsdays events feature a combination of curated talks (see open Calls for Proposals) and self organized open space content. Topics often include automation, testing, security, and organizational culture.

### History
The first devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. Since then, devopsdays events have multiplied, and if there isn’t one in your city, check out the information about organizing one yourself!

### About the organization
The devopsdays global core team guides local organizers in hosting their own devopsdays events worldwide. Active core organizers onboard and guide events, answer questions, and maintain the website. Advisory core organizers are less involved day-to-day but weigh in on important matters and assist as needed. Emeritus core organizers are no longer involved in the core team; we thank them for their past efforts.
